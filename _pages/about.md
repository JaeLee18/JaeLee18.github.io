- My name is Lee, Jae Joong and I am a Ph.D student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Professor Benes, Bedrich](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bbenes/). And I am a [member](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bbenes/students/) of [Computer Graphics and Visualization Laboratory](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/cgvlab/www/).
  <br/>
- My research interests focus on deep learning for computer vision, with an emphasis on 3D applications, including reconstruction and deep generative models.
  <br/>
- I received my Bachelor's Degree at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in Computer Science.
